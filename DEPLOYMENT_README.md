# 🚀 VebTask Multi-Tenant Deployment - Ready!

## ✅ What's Been Done

Your VebTask application has been successfully refactored into a **multi-tenant, organization-based system** with:

### 🏗 Core Features Added
- **Multi-tenant architecture** with organization isolation  
- **Role-based access control** (OWNER > ADMIN > STAFF > CLIENT)
- **Email invite system** with professional HTML templates
- **Google OAuth integration** alongside email/password auth
- **Password reset flow** with secure tokens
- **Member management** with role assignment and permissions
- **Organization switching** for users in multiple orgs

### 📊 Database Changes
- Added **5 new tables**: Organizations, Memberships, Invites, Accounts, Sessions
- Updated **4 existing tables** with `orgId` scoping: brain_dumps, macro_tasks, time_logs, calendar_events
- **Backfill script** ready to migrate existing single-tenant data

### 🎨 New UI Components  
- **Organization switcher** with role indicators
- **Member management page** with invite system
- **Professional email templates** for all communications

## 🎯 What To Do Next

### **Step 1: Push to GitHub**
1. Open **GitHub Desktop**
2. You'll see all the new files and changes
3. Add commit message: `COMPLETE: Multi-tenant organization system with RBAC, invites, and Google OAuth`
4. **Click "Commit to main"**
5. **Click "Push origin"**

### **Step 2: Railway Auto-Deploy**
- Railway will automatically deploy your code
- Check deployment logs in Railway dashboard
- Wait for deployment to complete (usually 2-5 minutes)

### **Step 3: Run Database Migration** (After Deploy)
```bash
# Use Railway CLI or dashboard terminal
railway run npm run db:seed
```

This converts your existing single-tenant data to multi-tenant.

## ⚡ What Happens to Existing Data

**✅ Completely Safe Migration:**
- **Existing users** → Get personal organizations automatically
- **Existing tasks/time logs/calendar** → Scoped to their personal org  
- **All functionality** → Continues working exactly as before
- **New features** → Available immediately (org management, invites, roles)

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

After deployment, verify:
- [ ] **Login works** (existing users can sign in)
- [ ] **Data intact** (tasks, time logs, calendar events visible)  
- [ ] **Organization created** (each user has a personal org)
- [ ] **Invite system** (send test invite to yourself)
- [ ] **Google OAuth** (try signing up with Google)
- [ ] **Password reset** (test forgot password flow)
