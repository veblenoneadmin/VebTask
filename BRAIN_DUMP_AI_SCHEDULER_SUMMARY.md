# AI-Powered Brain Dump Task Scheduler

## 🎯 **Purpose**
Transform unstructured employee thoughts into optimal daily task schedules using AI analysis. The system automatically creates time-blocked schedules that maximize productivity by considering task complexity, priority, and energy levels.

## ✨ **Key Features**

### 🧠 **Smart Brain Dump Processing**
- **Natural Language Input**: Type or voice-record thoughts naturally
- **Voice Recognition**: Built-in speech-to-text for hands-free input
- **AI Analysis**: Uses OpenRouter API (GPT-5 Nano) for intelligent task extraction
- **Fallback System**: Smart simulation when AI unavailable

### 📅 **Optimal Daily Scheduling**
- **Energy-Based Scheduling**: Places high-cognitive tasks during peak focus hours (9-11 AM, 2-4 PM)
- **Context Switching Reduction**: Groups similar tasks together
- **Priority Optimization**: Urgent tasks get morning slots when energy is highest
- **Buffer Time**: Automatic buffers between meetings and complex work
- **Workload Assessment**: Analyzes if daily schedule is Optimal/Heavy/Light

### 🔄 **Complete Integration**
- **Database Storage**: All tasks saved to `macro_tasks` table
- **Calendar Events**: Automatically creates time-blocked calendar entries
- **Task Management**: Seamless integration with existing task system
- **User Preferences**: Customizable working hours and scheduling preferences

## 🏗️ **Technical Architecture**

### Backend Components (`server.js`)

#### 1. **Enhanced AI System Prompt**
```javascript
// Specialized for optimal scheduling with focus on:
- Task complexity analysis
- Energy level considerations  
- Time block optimization
- Dependency management
- Productivity patterns
```

#### 2. **API Endpoints**

**POST** `/api/ai/process-brain-dump`
- Processes raw brain dump content
- Returns structured tasks with scheduling data
- Includes optimal time slots and energy requirements

**POST** `/api/brain-dump/save-tasks`
- Saves tasks to `macro_tasks` database
- Creates calendar events for optimal time slots
- Uses database transactions for data integrity
- Returns comprehensive save results

#### 3. **Smart Time Parsing**
```javascript
// Converts "9:00 AM - 11:00 AM" to database timestamps
- parseTimeSlot()
- parseTime()
- formatDateTime()
```

### Frontend Components (`BrainDump.tsx`)

#### 1. **Enhanced Task Interface**
```typescript
interface ProcessedTask {
  // Standard fields
  id, title, description, priority, estimatedHours, category, tags, microTasks
  
  // NEW: Scheduling fields
  optimalTimeSlot?: "9:00 AM - 11:00 AM"
  energyLevel?: "High|Medium|Low"
  focusType?: "Deep Work|Collaboration|Administrative"  
  suggestedDay?: "Today|Tomorrow|This Week"
}
```

#### 2. **Daily Schedule Display**
```typescript
interface DailySchedule {
  totalEstimatedHours: number
  workloadAssessment: "Optimal|Heavy|Light"
  recommendedOrder: string[]
  timeBlocks: [{
    time: string
    taskId: string
    rationale: string
  }]
}
```

#### 3. **Visual Schedule Components**
- **Schedule Summary Cards**: Total time and workload assessment
- **Time Block Display**: Chronological schedule with rationale
- **Optimal Time Indicators**: Visual cues for best scheduling times
- **Energy Level Badges**: Color-coded energy requirements

## 🎨 **User Experience Flow**

### 1. **Brain Dump Input** 🧠
```
User types/speaks: "Need to finish quarterly reports by Friday - complex analysis work. Call John about marketing campaign - urgent. Review budget proposal..."
```

### 2. **AI Processing** 🤖
```
AI analyzes and returns:
- 3 extracted tasks with priorities
- Optimal time slots based on complexity
- Energy level requirements
- Complete daily schedule
- Workload assessment
```

### 3. **Schedule Review** 📋
```
User sees:
- Visual schedule with time blocks
- Task cards with optimal scheduling info  
- Workload assessment (Optimal/Heavy/Light)
- Rationale for each time slot
```

### 4. **Save & Integration** ✅
```
Single click saves:
- Tasks to database
- Calendar events with time blocks
- Links to existing task/timer system
- Automatic navigation to task view
```

## 🔧 **Database Schema Integration**

### Enhanced `macro_tasks` Table
```sql
-- Stores AI scheduling metadata in tags JSON field:
{
  "tags": ["Frontend", "High Priority"],
  "microTasks": ["Step 1", "Step 2"],
  "energyLevel": "High",
  "focusType": "Deep Work", 
  "optimalTimeSlot": "9:00 AM - 11:00 AM",
  "suggestedDay": "Today"
}
```

### New `calendar_events` Table Usage
```sql
-- Creates time-blocked events like:
title: "🎯 Finish Quarterly Reports"
description: "Complex analysis work\n\nRationale: High-focus morning slot for complex cognitive work"
startTime: "2025-01-15 09:00:00"
endTime: "2025-01-15 11:00:00"
```

### `brain_dumps` Table
```sql
-- Stores complete processing results:
processedContent: {
  "extractedTasks": [...],
  "dailySchedule": {...},
  "savedAt": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

## 🧪 **Scheduling Algorithm**

### Core Principles
1. **Peak Performance Windows**: 9-11 AM, 2-4 PM for cognitive work
2. **Energy Matching**: High-energy tasks in morning, admin work afternoon
3. **Context Grouping**: Similar tasks clustered to reduce switching
4. **Priority Urgency**: Urgent items get optimal slots first
5. **Realistic Workload**: 6-7 productive hours maximum per day

### Sample Schedule Output
```
9:00 AM - 11:00 AM: 🎯 Quarterly Reports (High Priority)
└─ Rationale: High-focus morning slot for complex cognitive work

11:15 AM - 12:00 PM: 📞 Call John - Marketing (Urgent)  
└─ Rationale: Communication task after deep work session

2:00 PM - 3:30 PM: 📊 Review Budget Proposal (Medium Priority)
└─ Rationale: Analytical work during afternoon focus window

4:00 PM - 5:00 PM: 📅 Schedule Team Meeting (Low Priority)
└─ Rationale: Administrative task at day's end
```
